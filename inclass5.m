%Inclass assignment 5. 

% 1. Write a function that reads in an image and returns the intensity
% values of the brightest and dimest pixels as well as the indices of those 
% pixels - for example, for the max, the function should return ind_max1, 
% ind_max2, and max_value so that: 
% img(ind_max1,ind_max2) = max_value. 
% Get any black and white image and run this function on it (or get a color 
% image and convert to black and white - hint: take only one of the three 
% color channels).


% 2. (a) Write a function that reads in an image and displays it so that 1%
% of the pixels are black and 1% of the pixels are white. Hint: your
% function can call the builtin stretchlim function, see the help for that function.
% (b) Write a second function where the fraction of pixels to display as
% black or white are equal and can be specified as a second input to this
% function. (c) Redo part (b) but make the option to specify the fraction
% of black/white pixels optional with a default value of 1% if not
% specified.  Run your functions on the image you used for 1.
